* Commenting multiple lines:
----------------------------
To prepend (e.g. commenting lines) or append some text to multiple lines you can use vertical visual mode (C-v) to select the lines, then use "I" to prepend or "A" to append.

* Operate on a word object or a paragraph object:
-------------------------------------------------
iw: inner word
aw: a / around word
ip: inner paragraph
ap: a / around paragraph

* Move to previously edited lines back "g ;" and forth "g ,"
